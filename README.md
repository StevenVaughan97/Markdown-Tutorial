# Markdown Tutorial #
### By: Steven Vaughan ###
***
This tutorial was made in order to provide an understanding of Markdown. Within the tutorial I show how to do a lot of the basic functions of markdown including headers and tables, as well as including images and links. I demonstrate how to perform these operations relatively simply. Overall, this tutorial would be great for young adults and people just getting into web design. It mostly caters to those who have very little to no experience using Markdown, or other similar text editors.
